# Churn-Prediction-by-using-ANN
I'm new to machine learning and built this churn prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a learning project. The goal was to understand how deep learning can be applied to classification tasks like predicting customer churn. I used TensorFlow/Keras for the ANN  for data preprocessing. Feedback and suggestions are welcome! ðŸš€
